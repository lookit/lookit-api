This is the codebase for the Lookit project, an online developmental laboratory. It includes an Experimenter platform for designing and administering research studies, and a participant-facing platform where users can signup and take part in studies. It is built using Django, PostgreSQL, and Ember.js (see Ember portion of codebase, [ ember-lookit-frameplayer](https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer)), and is developed by [MIT](https://mit.edu) and [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/).
