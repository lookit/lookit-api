# Lookit-api

For full documentation, see <http://lookit.readthedocs.io>. The default documentation is based on the `current-docs` branch to allow frequent small updates without re-deployment, but documentation is also available for `develop` (used for the staging server) and `master` (used for production). 

This is the codebase for the Lookit project, an online developmental laboratory. It includes an Experimenter platform for designing and administering research studies, and a participant-facing platform where users can signup and take part in studies. It is built using Django, PostgreSQL, and Ember.js (see Ember portion of codebase, [ ember-lookit-frameplayer](https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer)), and is developed by [MIT](https://mit.edu) and [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/).
