        								<p>Trained MIT researchers who have been approved to work on the "Lookit" project will watch the video segments you send to mark down information specific to the study--for instance, what your child said, or how long he/she looked to the left versus the right of the screen.</p>
        								<p>Whether anyone else may view the video depends on the privacy settings you select at the end of the study. There are two decisions to make: whether to allow your data to be used by the Lookit team only or to share with Databrary, and how to allow your video clips to be used by the researchers you have selected.</p>
        								<p>First, we ask if you would like to share your data (including video) with authorized users fo the secure data library Databrary. Data sharing will lead to faster progress in research on human development and behavior. Researchers who are granted access to the Databrary library must agree to treat the data with the same high standard of care they would use in their own laboratories. Learn more about Databrary's <a href="https://databrary.org/about/mission.html">mission</a> or the <a href="https://databrary.org/access/responsibilities/investigators.html">requirements for authorized users</a>.</p>
        								<p>Next, we ask what types of uses of your video are okay with you.</p>
        								<ul>
        									<li><strong>Private</strong> This privacy level ensures that your video clips will be viewed only by authorized scientists (researchers working on the Lookit project and, if you have opted to share your data with Databrary, authorized Databrary users.) We will view the videos to record information about what your child did during the study--for instance, looking for 9 seconds at one image and 7 seconds at another image.</li>
        									<li><strong>Scientific and educational</strong> This privacy level gives permission to share your video clips with other researchers or students for scientific or educational purposes. For example, we might show a video clip in a talk at a scientific conference or an undergraduate class about cognitive development, or include an image or video in a scientific paper. In some circumstances, video or images may be available online, for instance as supplemental material in a scientific paper. Sharing videos with other researchers helps other groups trust and build on our work.</li>
        									<li><strong>Publicity</strong> This privacy level is for families who would be excited to see their child featured on the Lookit website or in the news! Selecting this privacy level gives permission to use your video clips to communicate about developmental studies and the Lookit platform with the public. For instance, we might post a short video clip on the Lookit website, on our Facebook page, or in a press release. Your video will never be used for commercial purposes.</li>
        								</ul>
        								<p>If for some reason you do not select a privacy level, we treat the data as 'Private' and do not share with Databrary. Participants also have the option to withdraw all video besides consent at the end of the study if necessary (for instance, because someone was discussing state secrets in the background). Privacy settings for completed sessions cannot be changed retroactively. If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, please contact our team at <a href="mailto:lookit@mit.edu">lookit@mit.edu</a>.</p>

        								<p>For children under about two years old, we usually design our studies to let their eyes do the talking! We're interested in where on the screen your child looks and/or how long your child looks at the screen rather than looking away. Our calibration videos (example shown below) help us get an idea of what it looks like when your child is looking to the right or the left, so we can code the rest of the video.</p>

        									</div>
        								</div>
        								<p>Your child's decisions about where to look can give us lots of information about what he or she understands. Here are some of the techniques our lab uses to learn more about how children learn.</p>
        								<h4>Habituation</h4>
        								<p>In a habituation study, we first show infants many examples of one type of object or event, and they lose interest over time. Infants typically look for a long time at the first pictures, but then they start to look away more quickly. Once their looking times are much less than they were initially, we show either a picture from a new category or a new picture from the familiar category. If infants now look longer to the novel example, we can tell that they understood--and got bored of--the category we showed initially.</p>
        								<p>Habituation requires waiting for each individual infant to achieve some threshold of "boredness"--for instance, looking half as long at a picture as he or she did initially. Sometimes this is impractical, and we use familiarization instead. In a familiarization study, we show all babies the same number of examples, and then see how interested they are in the familiar versus a new category. Younger infants and those who have seen few examples tend to show a familiarity preference--they look longer at images similar to what they have seen before. Older infants and those who have seen many examples tend to show a novelty preference--they look longer at images that are different from the ones they saw before. You probably notice the same phenomenon when you hear a new song on the radio: initially you don't recognize it; after it's played several times you may like it and sing along; after it's played hundreds of times you would choose to listen to anything else.</p>
        								<h4>Violation of expectation</h4>
        								<p>Infants and children already have rich expectations about how events work. Children (and adults for that matter) tend to look longer at things they find surprising, so in some cases, we can take their looking times as a measure of how surprised they are.</p>
        								<h4>Preferential looking</h4>
        								<p>Even when they seem to be passive observers, children are making lots of decisions about where to look and what to pay attention to. In this technique, we present children with a choice between two side-by-side images or videos, and see if children spend more time looking at one of them. We may additionally play audio that matches one of the videos. The video below shows a participant looking to her left when asked to "find clapping"; the display she's watching is shown at the top.</p>
        								<div class="row">
        									<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
        										<video controls="true" src="{settings.STATIC_URL}videos/clapping.mp4"></video>
        									</div>
        								</div>
        								<h4>Predictive looking</h4>
        								<p>Children can often make sophisticated predictions about what they expect to see or hear next. One way we can see those predictions in young children is to look at their eye movements. For example, if a child sees a ball roll behind a barrier, he may look to the other edge of the barrier, expecting the ball to emerge there. We may also set up artificial predictive relationships--for instance, the syllable "da" means a toy will appear at the left of the screen, and "ba" means a toy will appear at the right. Then we can see whether children learn these relationships, and how they generalize, by watching where they look when they hear a syllable.</p>
        								<p></p>
        								<p>Older children may simply be able to answer spoken questions about what they think is happening. For instance, in the "Learning from Others" study we ran last year, two women call an object two different made-up names, and children are asked which is the correct name for the object.</p>
        								<div class="row">
        									<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
        										<video controls="true" src="{settings.STATIC_URL}videos/causal_ex2.mp4"></video>
        									</div>
        								</div>
        								<p>Another way we can learn about how older children (and adults) think is to measure their reaction times. For instance, we might ask you to help your child learn to press one key when a circle appears and another key when a square appears, and then look at factors that influence how quickly they press a key.</p>

        								<p>Traditionally, developmental studies happen in a quiet room in a university lab.

We're hoping to...</p>

        								<p>For some studies, yes! Usually, we only interpret children's abilities and developmental trends at a group level, so the individual data collected just isn't very interpretable. But for "Baby physics" and other longitudinal studies (where we ask you to come back for more than one session), we'll be collecting enough data to give you a report of your child's responses after you complete all the sessions. Because this is a fairly labor-intensive process (we generally have two undergraduates watch each video and record where your child is looking each frame, and then we do some analysis to create a summary), it may take us several weeks to produce your report.</p>
        								<p>Please note that none of the measures we collect are diagnostic! For instance, while we hope you'll be interested to learn that your child looked 70% of the time at videos where things fell up versus falling down, we won't be able to tell you whether this means your child is going to be especially good at physics.</p>
        								<p>We are generally able to provide general feedback (confirming that we got your video and will be able to use it) within a week. To see this feedback, log in, then go to "Studies" and select "Past Studies."</p>

        				<h3>Activities to try at home</h3>
        				<p>Want to learn more about cognitive development? Here are some activities that may give you some insight into your own child's developing mind. Instead of studies our lab is running, these are "at home labs" for parents to try on their own--but please feel free to contact us with any questions!</p>
        				<h4>Learning about other minds: your child's developing theory of mind</h4><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxyVYATX9-M" width="560"></iframe>
        				<p><strong>Age range</strong>: 2.5 to 5 years</p>
        				<p><strong>What you'll need</strong>: For the "Maxi and the chocolate" story, any props you'd like (you can try drawing a picture or acting out the story). For the word-learning task, two containers to hold two objects your child doesn't know a name for (weird household objects like whisks or bike parts work great).</p>
        				<p>In this lab, you'll see how your child thinks about what other people are thinking. Children under about four years of age tend to show a lot of trouble expressing what's going on in situations where someone else knows less than they do. They will often absolutely insist that everyone knows what they themselves know!</p>
        				<h4>Learning to count: measuring your child's N-knower level</h4><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0q6H8MRXo8" width="560"></iframe>
        				<p><strong>Age range</strong>: 1 to 5 years</p>
        				<p><strong>What you'll need</strong>: At least ten small objects your child can pick up, like pegs or Cheerios</p>
        				<p><strong>A guided, online "give N" task is coming soon to Lookit!</strong></p>
        				<h4>Let your baby choose: understanding your infant's preferences</h4>
        				<p><img src="{settings.STATIC_URL}images/pacifier.png"></p>
        				<p><strong>Age range</strong>: 0 to 6 months</p>
        				<p><strong>What you'll need</strong>: A pacifier that your infant will suck on for about 15 minutes at a time and the operant conditioning web tool.</p>
        				<p>In this lab, you'll let your baby control what sound is played by sucking faster or slower on a pacifier. We recommend starting by trying to observe his or her preference for hearing music or a heartbeat. <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kimscott/instructions.html">Instructions</a></p>

        			<h3>Questions about the studies</h3>
        			<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the studies, please first check our FAQ. With any additional questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:lookit@mit.edu">lookit@mit.edu</a>.</p>
        			<h3>For researchers</h3>
        			<p>We are committed to making Lookit a tool for all developmental researchers and to keeping the code open-source. You can view the current <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/lookit" target="_blank">Lookit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/experimenter" target="_blank">Experimenter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/exp-addons" target="_blank">exp-addons</a> (specific frames for Lookit studies) codebases on github; <a href="https://github.com/kimberscott?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Kim's forks</a> may have more up-to-date versions of data analysis code.</p>
        			<p>We're not quite ready to start hosting additional studies from other labs yet, but our partners at the Center for Open Science are actively developing functionality for multiple labs to create and post their own studies on Lookit. Although we aim for the platform to be as accessible as possible, some familiarity with programming basics will be helpful for researchers. An ideal skillset for creating your own studies would include basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for study creation; passing familiarity with the <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.8.0/" target="_blank">Ember framework</a> used by Lookit and Experimenter; and python for data processing.</p>
        			<p>For updates on the Lookit platform and discussions about collaboration opportunities, you can <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/lookit-research" target="_blank">join the lookit-research email list</a>. Several initial test studies of a prototype Lookit platform were completed in 2015; please email Kim Scott (kimscott@mit.edu) if you'd like in-press manuscripts describing the results.</p>
