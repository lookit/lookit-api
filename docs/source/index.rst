Welcome to Lookit's documentation!
==========================================

**This documentation is a work in progress.** To contribute, submit a PR to
`lookit/lookit-api <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api/tree/develop>` in accordance with the Lookit Contributor Guidelines.

The `lookit-api codebase <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api>`_ contains
what were previously separate Experimenter and Lookit applications. Experimenter is a
platform for designing and administering research studies, meant for researchers.
The Lookit platform is participant-facing, where users can signup and take part in studies.
It is built using Django, PostgreSQL, and Ember.js (see Ember portion of codebase,
`ember-lookit-frameplayer <https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer>`_),
and has been developed by the `Center for Open Science <https://cos.io/>`_.
