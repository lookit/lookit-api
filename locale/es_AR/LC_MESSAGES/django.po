"Children can often make sophisticated predictions about what they expect to "

"to look at their eye movements. For example, if a child sees a ball roll "
"behind a barrier, she may look to the other edge of the barrier, expecting "
"the ball to emerge there. We may also set up artificial predictive "
"relationships--for instance, the syllable 'da' means a toy will appear at "
"the left of the screen, and 'ba' means a toy will appear at the right. Then "
"we can see whether children learn these relationships, and how they "
"generalize, by watching where they look when they hear a syllable."
