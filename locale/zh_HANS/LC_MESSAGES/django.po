"                                <p>In a habituation study, we first show "
"infants many examples of one type of object or event, and they lose interest "
"over time. Infants typically look for a long time at the first pictures, but "
"then they start to look away more quickly. Once their looking times are much "
"less than they were initially, we show either a picture from a new category "
"or a new picture from the familiar category. If infants now look longer to "
"the novel example, we can tell that they understood--and got bored of--the "

"                                <p>Habituation requires waiting for each "
"individual infant to achieve some threshold of \"boredness\"--for instance, "
"looking half as long at a picture as he or she did initially. Sometimes this "
"is impractical, and we use familiarization instead. In a familiarization "
"study, we show all babies the same number of examples, and then see how "
"interested they are in the familiar versus a new category. Younger infants "
"and those who have seen few examples tend to show a familiarity preference--"
"they look longer at images similar to what they have seen before. Older "
"infants and those who have seen many examples tend to show a novelty "
"preference--they look longer at images that are different from the ones they "
"saw before. You probably notice the same phenomenon when you hear a new song "
