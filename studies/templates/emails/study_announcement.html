    Note: If you have taken part in Lookit studies before, you might notice that the page looks a
    little different than before. Our web address is changing from lookit.mit.edu to childrenhelpingscience.com
    as we merge together two programs for online studies that our team runs. There have been no changes to who
    runs the platform or who can see your child's data.  Thanks for contributing to the science of how kids
    learn - we hope to see you soon!
