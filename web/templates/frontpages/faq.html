Then we'll guide you through what will happen during the study. Depending on your child's age, your child may answer questions directly or we may be looking for indirect signs of what she thinks is going on--like how long she looks at a surprising outcome.</p>
                                <p>Some portions of the study will be automatically recorded using your webcam and sent securely to the Lookit platform. Trained researchers will watch the video and record your child's responses--for instance, which way he pointed, or how long she looked at each image. We'll put these together with responses from lots of other children to learn more about how kids think!</p>

                                Researchers using Lookit agree to uphold a common set of standards about how data is protected and shared. For instance, they never publish children's names or birthdates, or information that could be used to calculate a birthdate.</p>
                                <p>The Lookit researcher interface is designed with participant data protection as the top priority. For instance, a special interface lets researchers confirm consent videos before they are able to download any other data from your session. Research groups can control who has access to what data in a very fine-grained way, for instance allowing an assistant to confirm consent and send gift cards, but not download study data.</p>
                                <p>All of your data, including video, is transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection to Lookit storage, and is encrypted at rest. We take security very seriously; in addition to making sure any software we use is up-to-date, cloud servers are configured securely, and unit tests cover checking that accessing data requires correct permissions, we conducted a risk assessment and detailed manual penetration testing with a security contractor prior to our 2020 launch.</p>

                                <p>Lookit staff at MIT will have access to your video and other data in order to improve and promote the platform and help with troubleshooting. The researchers running the study you participated in will also have access to your video and other data (like responses to questions during the study, and information you fill out when registering a child) for research purposes. They will watch the video segments you send to mark down information specific to the study--for instance, what your child said, or how long he/she looked to the left versus the right of the screen. This research group may be at MIT or at another institution. All studies run on Lookit must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) that ensures participants' rights and welfare are protected. All researchers using Lookit also agree to Terms of Use that govern what data they can share and what sorts of studies are okay to run on Lookit; these rules are sometimes stricter than their own institution might be.  </p>
                                <p>Whether anyone else may view the video depends on the privacy settings you select at the end of the study. There are two decisions to make: whether to share your data with Databrary, and how to allow your video clips to be used by the researchers you have selected.</p>
                                <p>First, we ask if you would like to share your data (including video) with authorized users fo the secure data library Databrary. Data sharing will lead to faster progress in research on human development and behavior. Researchers who are granted access to the Databrary library must agree to treat the data with the same high standard of care they would use in their own laboratories. Learn more about Databrary's <a href="https://databrary.org/about.html">mission</a> or the <a href="https://databrary.org/about/agreement.html">requirements for authorized users</a>.</p>
                                <p>Next, we ask what types of uses of your video are okay with you.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Private</strong> This privacy level ensures that your video clips will be viewed only by authorized scientists (Lookit staff, the research group running the study and, if you have opted to share your data with Databrary, authorized Databrary users.) They will view the videos to record information about what your child did during the study--for instance, looking for 9 seconds at one image and 7 seconds at another image.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Scientific and educational</strong> This privacy level gives permission to share your video clips with other researchers or students for scientific or educational purposes. For example, researchers might show a video clip in a talk at a scientific conference or an undergraduate class about cognitive development, or include an image or video in a scientific paper. In some circumstances, video or images may be available online, for instance as supplemental material in a scientific paper. Sharing videos with other researchers helps other groups trust and build on our work.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Publicity</strong> This privacy level is for families who would be excited to see their child featured on the Lookit website or in the news! Selecting this privacy level gives permission to use your video clips to communicate about developmental studies and the Lookit platform with the public. For instance, we might post a short video clip on the Lookit website, on our Facebook page, or in a press release. Your video will never be used for commercial purposes.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If for some reason you do not select a privacy level, we treat the data as 'Private' and do not share with Databrary. Participants also have the option to withdraw all video besides consent at the end of the study if necessary (for instance, because someone was discussing state secrets in the background), and in this case it is automatically deleted. Privacy settings for completed sessions cannot automatically be changed retroactively. If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, please contact our team at <a href="mailto:lookit@mit.edu">lookit@mit.edu</a>.</p>

                                <p>In a habituation study, we first show infants many examples of one type of object or event, and they lose interest over time. Infants typically look for a long time at the first pictures, but then they start to look away more quickly. Once their looking times are much less than they were initially, we show either a picture from a new category or a new picture from the familiar category. If infants now look longer to the novel example, we can tell that they understood--and got bored of--the category we showed initially.</p>
                                <p>Habituation requires waiting for each individual infant to achieve some threshold of "boredness"--for instance, looking half as long at a picture as he or she did initially. Sometimes this is impractical, and we use familiarization instead. In a familiarization study, we show all babies the same number of examples, and then see how interested they are in the familiar versus a new category. Younger infants and those who have seen few examples tend to show a familiarity preference--they look longer at images similar to what they have seen before. Older infants and those who have seen many examples tend to show a novelty preference--they look longer at images that are different from the ones they saw before. You probably notice the same phenomenon when you hear a new song on the radio: initially you don't recognize it; after it's played several times you may like it and sing along; after it's played hundreds of times you would choose to listen to anything else.</p>

We may also set up artificial predictive relationships--for instance, the syllable 'da' means a toy will appear at the left of the screen, and 'ba' means a toy will appear at the right. Then we can see whether children learn these relationships, and how they generalize, by watching where they look when they hear a syllable."%}</p>

                                <p>For some studies, yes! Usually, developmental researchers only interpret children's abilities and developmental trends at a group level, and the individual data collected just isn't very interpretable. But for "Your baby, the physicist" and other longitudinal studies (where you come back for more than one session), we can sometimes collect enough data to give you a report of your child's responses after you complete all the sessions.</p>
                                <p>Please note that none of the measures we collect are diagnostic! For instance, while we hope you'll be interested to learn that your child looked 70% of the time at videos where things fell up versus falling down, we won't be able to tell you whether this means your child is going to be especially good at physics.</p>
