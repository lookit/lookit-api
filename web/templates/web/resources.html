<h2 class="border-bottom pb-2 pt-5 mb-4">Activities to try at home</h2>
<p>
    Want to learn more about cognitive development? Here are some activities that may give you some insight
    into your own child's developing mind. Instead of studies our lab is running, these are "at home labs"
    for parents to try on their own--but please feel free to contact us with any questions!
</p>
<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Learning about other minds: your child's developing theory of mind</h4>

</div>
<p>
    <strong>Age range</strong>: 2.5 to 5 years
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What you'll need</strong>: For the "Maxi and the chocolate" story, any props you'd like (you can try drawing a picture or acting out the story). For the word-learning task, two containers to hold two objects your child doesn't know a name for (weird kitchen tools, bike parts, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    In this lab, you'll see how your child thinks about what other people are thinking.
    Children under
    about
    four years old tend to have trouble expressing what's going on when someone else knows
    less than
    they
    do. They will often insist that everyone knows what they themselves know!

</div>
<p>
    <strong>Age range</strong>: 1 to 5 years
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What you'll need</strong>:
At least ten small objects your child can pick up, like pegs or Cheerios.
