                                Want to learn more about cognitive development? Here are some activities that may give
                                you some
                                insight
                                into your own child's developing mind. Instead of studies our lab is running, these are
                                "at home
                                labs"
                                for parents to try on their own--but please feel free to contact us with any questions!

                        can
                        try drawing a picture or acting out the story). For the word-learning task, two

                        two
                        objects your child doesn't know a name for (weird kitchen tools, bike parts, etc.).

                        In this lab, you'll see how your child thinks about what other people are thinking.

                        about
                        four years old tend to have trouble expressing what's going on when someone else knows
                        less than
                        they
                        do. They will often insist that everyone knows what they themselves know!
