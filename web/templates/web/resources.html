        <p>
            Want to learn more about cognitive development? Here are some activities that may give you some insight
            into your own child's developing mind. Instead of studies our lab is running, these are "at home labs"
            for parents to try on their own--but please feel free to contact us with any questions!
        </p>

            <strong>Age range</strong>: 2.5 to 5 years
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What you'll need</strong>: For the "Maxi and the chocolate" story, any props you'd like (you can try drawing a picture or acting out the story). For the word-learning task, two containers to hold two objects your child doesn't know a name for (weird kitchen tools, bike parts, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lab, you'll see how your child thinks about what other people are thinking.
            Children under
            about
            four years old tend to have trouble expressing what's going on when someone else knows
            less than
            they
            do. They will often insist that everyone knows what they themselves know!
