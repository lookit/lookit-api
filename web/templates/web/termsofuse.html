                <li>
                    Study data, including video: responses collected during a child’s participation in a
                    particular Lookit study: webcam video of the child and parent as well as text data
                    including form responses, on-screen selections, which stimuli were shown, etc.
                </li>

                            instance, to facilitate financial record-keeping and any necessary linking of accounts
                            and children across studies. The 5-character account, child, and demographic "ID" fields
                            provided for download may be published; these are specific to the study. Researchers
                            wishing to publish persistent identifiers for data from multiple connected studies must
                            either create a table linking IDs across studies, or generate their own random IDs.

                        the study itself or regarding the study’s purpose and procedures. </strong>Examples
                        include telling the child that he or she performed better or worse than peers when
                        children were in fact assigned randomly to receive such feedback; telling a parent that
                        researchers expect to observe a particular behavior that is not actually expected, in
                        order to avoid parental bias; or failing to disclose in a study about child-parent
                        interaction that the researchers are primarily interested in gender differences in
                        interaction styles.

                        In all study designs, the child must remain in the same room with his or her parent at
                        all times. No infancy study session (for children 0 - 12 months) may be designed to last
                        longer than 30 minutes, and no experiment session may be designed to last longer than 90
                        minutes. Purely observational periods may extend longer if approved by Lookit--for
                        instance, if the goal of a study is to observe conversation during a family meal or
                        independent child play.

                        must be available in any study posted on Lookit and conducted elsewhere. Parents must be
                        informed of this option at the beginning of every study.

                        the right to require any studies posted on the Lookit platform to conduct informed

                    Researchers may study participants from birth through seventeen years of age (i.e., until the
                    eighteenth birthday) and their parents or legal guardians on Lookit. Researchers may also
                    study adult participants. For studies with only adult participants, researchers agree to
                    record a statement of informed consent from the participant. <strong>For studies with child
                    participants, researchers agree to record a statement of informed consent from a child
                    participant’s parent or legal guardian at the start of any Lookit study, and to
                    additionally record a statement of assent from any child participant aged eight years or
                    older.</strong>Parents and guardians of all ages may consent to participation on behalf
                    of themselves and their children (that is, if the parent is a minor, his or her own parent’s
                    consent is not additionally required).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If only parental consent is obtained, data from child participants eight years of age and
                    older must be treated as if valid consent was not obtained. Researchers may at their own
                    discretion and/or based on their own institution’s policies record an assent statement from
                    children under eight years as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consent/assent may occur after a webcam setup/configuration step but must precede any other
                    Lookit study elements. Researchers must use the standard Lookit consent and, if applicable,
                    assent form element(s) for this section, providing additional text relevant to the
                    particular study which will be inserted in the spaces indicated. No translations or
                    adaptations of these elements may be used without the approval of both the Researchers’
                    institutional review board and Lookit. For studies that involve any webcam access, a verbal
                    (or ASL) statement of consent (and assent if applicable) must be recorded via webcam. For
                    studies that do not involve any webcam or audio recording (e.g., that consist entirely of a
                    survey), Lookit’s non-webcam form elements may be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers agree that they will view the consent recording before viewing any other video
                    data collected during the same session and that they will check that the recording
                    demonstrates informed adult consent and child assent if applicable. If the statement(s) is
                    audible (or a signed statement in ASL is interpretable), appropriate study measures may then
                    be coded by the researcher and the data may be used for research purposes. If a technical
                    issue (e.g. lack of audio recording) prevented collection of informed consent from the
                    parent, and the parent has set communication preferences to allow researchers to email with
                    questions about their participation, Researchers may instead confirm consent by emailing the
                    account holder and receiving back a reply that contains the statement “Yes, I am this
                    child's parent or legal guardian and we both agreed to participate in this study” or text
                    equivalent in meaning.

                    Unless parental consent and, if applicable, child assent are confirmed, Researchers may not
                    view any other video associated with this study session, and may not use any other data from
                    the session in their analysis, although the number of such records and aggregate data about
                    the associated accounts (e.g., how many unique children, how many were in the age range) may
                    be reported. Researchers are responsible for storing and maintaining any necessary records
                    of confirmation of consent/assent.

            <div class="m-4">
                <p>
                    Researchers agree to solicit selections for the privacy level of video data at the end of any
                    Lookit study that is conducted on the Lookit platform. Researchers must use the standard
                    Lookit exit survey element for this section, providing additional text relevant to the
                    particular study which will be inserted in the spaces indicated. Parents must have the
                    option to withdraw their video from the study at this point. Language may be modified,
                    subject to approval by Lookit, as required by Researchers’ institutional review board (for
                    instance, to add more detail about Databrary).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If video is withdrawn for a session, any video other than the consent recording will be
                    automatically made unavailable by Lookit. In the event that Researchers download data during
                    an ongoing study session and video is later withdrawn, and in the event of any discrepancy
                    between withdrawal information and Lookit's automatic removal of video, Researchers agree to
                    delete without viewing any associated session video they have downloaded other than the
                    consent recording.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers may share video and other session data, account data, child data, and demographic
                    data on Databrary for sessions where parents opt to allow this usage, subject to approval of
                    the appropriate institutional review board. Researchers agree to share video data only in
                    accordance with the parent’s privacy selections. If privacy selections are missing, video
                    must be treated either as if withdrawn or as if the parent had selected ‘private’ use, and
                    data must not be shared with Databrary.

            <div class="m-4">
                <p>
                    Researchers may choose whether to pay participants, and the form of payment, subject to any
                    applicable IRB review at their own institutions. The purpose of payment must be to
                    compensate participants for their time and effort, and must not be coercive. Lookit may set
                    guidelines for acceptable payment ranges. Payment may include: money or gift certificates,
                    or physical prizes (e.g., an age-appropriate book or game), either emailed or sent via
                    postal mail. Future payment options may include Lookit points, redeemable on the Lookit
                    Platform for gift certificates and other prizes, and may be pooled across studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information about payment must be included in the study description submitted to Lookit and
                    is subject to Lookit approval. This information must include when, how, how much, and under
                    what conditions participants will be paid.
                    <strong>
                        Without prior approval by Lookit, payment
                        may not depend on the child’s behavior or performance, even if that behavior renders
                        data unusable (e.g., if an infant fusses and his parent ends the session
                        early).
                    </strong>
                    Payment may not depend on the parent’s video privacy selections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if payment is to be sent via postal mail, families may not be required to provide a
                    mailing address in order to participate. When practical, families should be offered the
                    opportunity to select alternate compensation in this case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers are responsible for verifying participation and sending payment or recording the
                    number of Lookit points participants should receive. Researchers are responsible for the
                    cost of all participant payment, including reimbursing Lookit for Lookit points based on a
                    price agreed upon at the start of the study. Lookit may, at its discretion, also choose to
                    itself offer Lookit points for study participation. Researchers are not responsible for the
                    costs of such compensation.
